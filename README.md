# 🧬 CRISPR-Cas9 PAM Recognition Web App

This is a simple web application built with Python and Flask that identifies **NGG PAM sequences** used in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. It allows users to input DNA sequences and highlights regions where Cas9 can bind.

## 🔍 What It Does
- Accepts DNA input from the user
- Searches for **NGG** PAM sequences (specific to Cas9)
- Displays matching regions in a clean, user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML/CSS

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
